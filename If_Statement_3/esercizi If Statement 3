Exercise: If Statement 3

define a class called Student that has:
    2 instance variables:
        a string name
        an integer age
    a constructor method that takes as parameters studentName and studentAge, assigning the values to the 2 instance variables
    a method guessingAge that:
        generates a random integer (using java.util.Random and nextInt()) that has 35 as upperbound
        prints the random value generated for name (e.g. I generated the random number X for student Y)
        prints if the random value is equal, greater or lower to the Student's age
define a testing class where you:
    create a Student with your name and your age
    call the guessingAge method
