Exercise: static

define a class Employee with:
    3 instance variables name, surname and address
    a constructor method that assigns 3 params (newEmployeeName, newEmployeeSurname, newEmployeeAddress) to the respective object's properties
    a method getEmployeeDetails() that returns an informative String with all the details of the Employee

define a class Badge with:
    a private static int variable called totalNumberOfEmployees (the value of this variable will be shared across multiple class instances)
    a private String variable called badgeIdCode
    a public Employee variable called employee
    a private static void method called keepTrackOfEmployeesNumber() that increments by 1 the totalNumberOfEmployees
    a private String method called generateBadgeIdCode() that returns a String containing name and surname of the employee between two random String codes (e.g. XYZNameSurnameZYX)
    a public void method called showBadgeDetails() that informs the user about:
        the total number of employee tracked by the badges
        the details of the employee
        the badgeIdCode
    a constructor method that takes an Employee param called employeeThatNeedsBadge and:
        call the static method for keeping track of the number of employees
        assign the value of employeeThatNeedsBadge to the object's employee property
        assign a generated id code to the object's badgeIdCode

define a tester class where you:
    create 2 new Employee objects
    create their new 2 Badge
    show to the user the 2 employees' badge details
